# gwc_hello_git
An introduction to git, github, and open source! 

Today, we will be learning about some basic, low-level concepts that often aren't taught in school. 

1) Open your terminal.
"Open my what??"

MacOS pro-tip detour!! 
Try pressing command-spacebar on your keyabord. This will open the Mac searchlight bar. Type "Terminal" in the search bar and hit return on the first result. This will open your terminal. You can also drag the terminal onto your Mac's dock, since you'll probably use it a lot. 

Ok. Now you have the terminal open. You can customize your terminal too, there's a link in "Further reading."

2) Now that you have your terminal open, the first thing we're going to do is configure git. Git has already been installed on your latptops. Of course, use your name and email address instead of the examples below. Congratulations! You're now a git user. 

```git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"```
```git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"```

3) Next we're going to pair up and make your first git repo. We're going to do what's called pair programming, where you both work at one workstation (laptop.) Often, developers do this because a second set of eyes catches bugs faster while the code is still being written. Today, we're doing it so you can learn how git is used to share code between two (or more) people. 

On laptop #1, type the following linux commands into your terminal 

```cd ~/Desktop```
```Mkdr my_first_repo```
```cd my_first_repo```
```git init```

Yay! You've made an empty repository. 

"A what?" 

A reposistory is where you can upload code. For today's demo, we're going to be using github.com for our repository, but there are other services that serve the same function.
